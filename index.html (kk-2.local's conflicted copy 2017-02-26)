<h3 id="the-occasion-api-is-in-beta-we-are-currently-developing-the-endpoints-and-might-change-them-we-will-freeze-them-in-the-near-future">The Occasion API is in BETA. We are currently developing the endpoints and might change them. We will freeze them in the near future.</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Occasion API! You can use our API to access Occasion API endpoints, which can be used to interact with all levels of functionality available to Occasion users, including: products, venues, orders, coupons, gift cards, customers, payment methods, users, calendars, etc.</p>

<p>We have planned language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Javascript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.</p>

<p><strong>Right now, query can only be made via Shell (cURL, etc.), but we plan on releasing a Javascript library followed by Ruby.</strong></p>

<h1 id="format">Format</h1>

<p>All requests and responses are in JSON format, adhering to the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/format/">JSON API schema</a>. In the examples at right, we use the readable format of URLs including <code class="prettyprint">[, ]</code> and others. Note, you&rsquo;ll have to format your URL to be safe before you make your request, replacing these symbols with their Unicode identifiers.</p>

<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>To authorize, use this code:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c"># With cURL, you can make use of the -u option to create a basic authentication header</span>
curl <span class="s2">"api_endpoint_here"</span>
  -u <span class="s2">"[API_LOGIN]:[API_SECRET]"</span>
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Make sure to insert your own API login and secret keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, all calls to Occasion API use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP basic authentication</a> over HTTPS.</p>

<p>Basic authentication requires a login key and a secret key. You can find your API keys on your <a href="https://app.getoccasion.com/users/edit">account page</a>. You must be signed into your account to view this page.</p>

<p>Occasion requires that at the very least your API login key be provided with all queries made to our servers. Some endpoints are public, and only require an API login key. Others are private, and require that your API secret key be provided as well. Unless noted otherwise, all endpoints are public.</p>

<p>The data that an endpoint responds with may vary depending of whether or not a secret key was provided. For example, making a public call to <code class="prettyprint">GET /products</code> will respond with a list of all your products, but any sensitive information will not be included. Making a private call (the secret key included) to the same endpoint will respond with all of your products, with all their information included. This allows you to use the API in a public environment without having to worry about any sensitive data being compromised. The difference between response bodies will be noted in the information regarding each endpoint.</p>
